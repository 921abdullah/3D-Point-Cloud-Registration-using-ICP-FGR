# 3D-Point-Cloud-Registration-using-ICP-FGR
When a LiDAR scanner (e.g., on a car or robot) captures 3D data from different positions, each scan is in its own coordinate system. To combine these scans into a single 3D map, we must align (or “register”) them accurately.  This process is called Point Cloud Registration.
